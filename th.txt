c --> pop [procedure oriented programming] 
c++ --> oop [object oriented programming]

        --> class, objects , inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism



class -> logical , group, generalization |
object -> member, physical, specific, specialization

class use ==> variable + method
object use ==> property [variable + method]


class == structure 

// struct Student{

//     int id;
//     char name[20];
//     char address[20];
} s;


class Student {


};

Student S;

oops : 
        1) oops follow top down approach
        2) oops is an object driven language
        3) oops is an object based programming language : objest is more important than data
        4) opps is an non sequential programming language : instruction is not in sequential order
        5) oops is an non structured programming language : no structure is followed      


class based approach


iostream : input stream + output stream



                                IOS ---> Present Class 

        input ---> istream [input stream]               output ---> ostream [output stream]

                                  iostream            




oops concept :
        1) class and object
        2) inheritance
        3) polymorphism
        4) encapsulation
        5) abstraction


1) class and object: 

        class : class is a user defined data type which is used to represent the logical grouping of data and function.
              : class is group of data member and function member.
              : class is a blueprint of object.


object : object is entity / identity of class
